    "text": "Hi! I’m Louie Neri. I’m a nurse researcher with a lot of interests, mainly in biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, nutrition, exercise science, and mental health.\nI graduated with a BSN-RD (Research Distinction) from UT Health San Antonio and was an undergraduate researcher at the Audie Murphy VA Hospital/UT Health San Antonio Barshop Institute. My research focus was on the connection between nutrition, lifestyle, and outcomes in stroke, diabetes, and cognitive decline.\nCurrently, I work as the Senior Coordinator for Evidence Based Surgery at the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, where I spearhead efforts to create clinical practice guidelines. I am also an incoming MSPH student with a concentration in Oucomes Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Previously, I worked as a Researcher and Team Lead at Examine.com, the internet’s largest nutrition database."

His dedication to self-improvement through understanding the scientific principles of biochemistry and research methods is unparalleled. It was a true joy to have Louie in my courses as we constantly encourage mutual curiosity by debating the latest science. I am grateful to count him as a student and friend, and I am honored for him to be a professional colleague in the scientific community.”\n\nDeana Apple, PhD"
