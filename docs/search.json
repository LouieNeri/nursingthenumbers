I’m a nurse researcher with a passion for biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, nutrition, exercise science, and mental health.\nI earned my BSN with Research Distinction from UT Health San Antonio, where I researched the impact of nutrition and lifestyle on stroke, diabetes, and cognitive decline.\nCurrently, I’m the Senior Coordinator for Evidence Based Surgery at The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, where I’m lucky enough to work with some outstanding surgeons to develop clinical practice guidelines. I’m also an incoming MSPH student in Outcomes Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Previously, I was a Researcher and Team Lead at Examine.com, the largest online nutrition database."

    "text": "Some kind words from a close mentor:\n\n“It is rare to find a human as inquisitive as Louie. He has the soul of a scientist, the heart of a physician, and the cleverness of a crow. His dedication to self-improvement through understanding the scientific principles of biochemistry and research methods is unparalleled. It was a true joy to have Louie in my courses as we constantly encourage mutual curiosity by debating the latest science. I am grateful to count him as a student and friend, and I am honored for him to be a professional colleague in the scientific community.”\n\nDeana Apple, PhD"
