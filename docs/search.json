I’m a nurse researcher with a passion for biostatistics, epidemiology, health economics, nutrition, exercise science, and mental health.\nI earned my BSN with Research Distinction from UT Health San Antonio, where I researched the impact of nutrition and lifestyle on stroke, diabetes, and cognitive decline.\nCurrently, I’m the Senior Coordinator for Evidence Based Surgery at The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, where I’m lucky enough to work with some outstanding surgeons to develop clinical practice guidelines. I’m also an incoming MSPH student in Outcomes Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Previously, I was a Researcher and Team Lead at Examine.com, the largest online nutrition database."

His dedication to self-improvement through understanding the scientific principles of biochemistry and research methods is unparalleled. It was a true joy to have Louie in my courses as we constantly encourage mutual curiosity by debating the latest science. I am grateful to count him as a student and friend, and I am honored for him to be a professional colleague in the scientific community.”\n\nDeana Apple, PhD"

Welcome to the inaugural post of my blog “Nursing the numbers.”\nAs a quick introduction, I’m Louie Neri, a nurse who never ended up nursing, somwhow ended up in the nutrition science world, and now find myself in the clinical practice guideline universe. I wanted to give a brief introduction to myself, how I got here, and the goal of this blog.\n\nHealth issues and functional medicine\nI first got interested in science because of a myriad of health issues that had me bed-ridden in high school. Although I will spare the details (perhaps I can explain this for another time), I ended up dislocating my shoulder playing basketball, resulting in a paradoxical bilateral frozen shoulder, could not stand up straight without feeling like I was going to pass out, covered in severe (and I mean severe eczema), severe gastritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), concurrently. All at the ripe age of 17.\nAll I had left was free time, and my laptop. Scouring the internet for answers, I ended up in engrossed in the functional medicine world, trying to teach myself as much about the human body as possible. I found a local functional medicine doctor in my town, who miraculously healed me with a combination of dietary supplements and meditation. After trying a few different career paths, this experience led me to go to nursing school, with the hopes of becoming some sort of holistic-yet-scientific nurse practitioner.\n\n\nReturning to mainstream medicine and\nNow, this isn’t some sort of miracle healing story. My ailments began to return while getting my pre-requisite classess for nursing school, which involved a bunch of basic science classes.\nTaking these classes made me realize how much I did not know, and was better able to evaluate the claims commonly made in health research. I ended up being disengaged with functional medicine as a whole, realizing how poor the research truly was.\nWhen I went to nursing school, I got lucky to go to a huge academic research institution, where we had a “research distinction” program. By sheer luck, I got matched with a nutrition health scientist as my advisor, where I was able to see how science really worked.\nI now find myself more aligned with more “mainstream” medicine (whatever that means). I’m now interested more in the big picture of how our healthcare system works, as opposed to the nitty gritty details of treating patients (although I do miss that work).\nAfter graduating with my BSN and doing some nutrition research, I ended up working for the amazing company Examine.com, and now I develop clinical practice guidelines for a medical association."
